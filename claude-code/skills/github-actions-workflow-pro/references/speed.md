# Speed reference

The rules behind the speed lines of the SKILL.md checklist, with the reason for each. Almost none of these are checked by a scanner, so in an audit they come from reading the YAML and the run history (`scripts/run-stats.py`). Read this when the user reports slow CI, when adding a matrix, path filter, or cache, or when writing the speed section of an audit. Fast workflows get maintained; slow ones get ignored, so quick feedback is worth a few extra lines of YAML but never clever YAML.

## Find the slow steps before changing anything

`scripts/run-stats.py --markdown` ranks steps as well as workflows and jobs, and flags every step whose mean is at or over 2 minutes (`--slow-step-minutes M` moves the cut, fractions allowed). A job is slow because of one or two of its steps, so the step table says which line to change; the workflow table only says which file to open. Ask the user what cut matters to them once they see the 2-minute list, because the long tail worth fixing in a 40-minute pipeline starts somewhere different from one that finishes in 90 seconds.

## Cancel superseded runs

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

A new push to the same PR or branch makes the running build stale; cancelling it frees the runner for the run that matters. Deploy and release workflows are the exception: cancelling a deploy mid-flight is worse than waiting, so give them their own group with `cancel-in-progress: false` (a queue) rather than sharing the CI group. zizmor `concurrency-limits` (pedantic) detects a missing block; whether the group is right for a deploy is yours to check.

## Order jobs cheap to expensive

Lint, typecheck, and unit tests run first; build, integration, and deploy jobs declare `needs:` on them. A broken import fails in thirty seconds instead of after a ten-minute image build, and the expensive jobs never start on a red commit. Cheap jobs that do not depend on each other run in parallel; `needs:` is for a job that would waste runner time on a red predecessor, not for ordering the fast ones.

## Run independent steps in parallel inside one job

A job whose steps share a checkout and one dependency install can overlap them: a `parallel:` block for a self-contained group, or `background: true` plus `wait`, `wait-all`, and `cancel` for a service that stays up while later steps run. GitHub shipped these four step keys on 2026-06-25, later than your training data, so read [parallel-steps.md](parallel-steps.md) for the syntax, the ten-step limit, the failure semantics, and the cases that race before you write any of it. Splitting the job in two would repeat the checkout and the install and would pass the workspace through artifacts, so for shared state this is the cheaper shape; for a different OS, runtime, or permission set, a separate job is still the answer.

## Cache through the setup action

Use the cache the official setup action provides: `actions/setup-node` with `cache: npm` (or `pnpm`, `yarn`), `actions/setup-python` with `cache: pip`, `actions/setup-go` (caching on by default), and Buildx with `cache-from: type=gha` / `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max` for images. The setup action derives the cache key from the lockfile, so the key is right without hand-written `hashFiles` logic. Reach for `actions/cache` directly only when no setup action covers the tool.

`type=gha` cache is scoped per branch by default: a PR from a new branch misses on its first build and falls through to the default branch's cache. That is expected, not a bug to fix.

## Time-box jobs that can hang

Set `timeout-minutes` on jobs that talk to the network, run integration suites, or deploy. The default is 360 minutes: a hung job burns six hours of runner time and, with concurrency on, blocks the next run in its group. Ten to thirty minutes covers most jobs; pick a value near twice the normal run time.

A job that `uses:` a reusable workflow cannot set `timeout-minutes` (GitHub rejects it), so the timeout belongs in the called workflow's jobs. A reusable workflow with unknown callers hardcodes a generous value or exposes `timeout-minutes` as an input.

## Path filters only when obviously correct

On CI workflows, skip runs that touch only docs:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - "**.md"
      - "docs/**"
```

Security, release, and deploy workflows stay unfiltered: a workflow that runs on "relevant" paths is a workflow that silently stops running when someone moves a file. Path-filtered jobs that are also required status checks block the PR forever, because a skipped workflow never reports; keep required checks unfiltered or add a no-op job that always reports. A new CI workflow is the likeliest future required check, so ship it unfiltered and offer the filter as a follow-up once the user knows which checks are required.

## Fan out only for confidence

A matrix earns its cost when each cell tests something the others cannot: a supported OS, a runtime version the project promises to support, an architecture that ships. Cells with identical inputs are the same test paid for twice. actionlint flags literal duplicate matrix values; runner aliases (`ubuntu-latest` is `ubuntu-24.04` today) are yours to spot. Use `fail-fast: false` when the user wants every cell's result rather than the first failure, and `include:`/`exclude:` to trim cells that cannot happen.

## Checkout depth

`actions/checkout` fetches one commit by default, which is what CI needs. Release jobs that read tags (`docker/metadata-action` semver tags, changelog tools) need `fetch-depth: 0`; set it only in that job rather than everywhere.
